# CoreView

An AI-powered peer review assistant that brings Cursor-like intelligence to academic paper review.

## Overview

CoreView is a modern peer review tool that combines PDF annotation with AI assistance to streamline and enhance the academic review process. Think of it as "Cursor for peer review" - providing intelligent, context-aware assistance throughout the review workflow.

### AI-Powered Review Assistance
- Contextual suggestions while reviewing papers
- Auto-completion of review comments
- Smart highlighting of potential issues and areas of concern
- Intelligent question generation based on paper content

## Key Features

### Interactive PDF Review
- Load and navigate academic papers in PDF format
- Take screenshots or select regions of the paper for focused discussion (screenshot capture helps when PDFs have poor text selection)
- Ask questions about particular parts of the paper with visual context

### Automated Verification Tools
- **Proof Checking**: Automatically verify mathematical proofs and logical arguments
- **Citation Verification**: Verify that citations actually support the claims made in the paper
- **Statistical Analysis**: Detect potential p-hacking and questionable research practices
- **Code Verification**: Analyze embedded code snippets for correctness and reproducibility

## Planned Architecture

- **Frontend**: Modern web interface for PDF viewing and annotation
- **AI Integration**: LLM-powered analysis and question answering
- **Backend Services**: 
  - PDF processing and rendering
  - Screenshot capture and management
  - Automated verification engines
  - Citation claim verification
